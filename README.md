Diving into databases and how to build things on top of them!

I think I am moving along nicely in my programming journey with having learned a lot of technologies overall. I think I can still do better to broaden the kind of things I can build though, I don't have much experience yet in doing that. I need to have more experience with building fullstack apps that include both the client, server, and a database to store data for that site as well.

I'm going to start with MySQL, then move on to other database options like NoSQL-based ones, such as MongoDB for example. It sounds like that is used for most web apps that use JSON data for what has to be stored.

Not as specific to this project, lately I've been curious how you can use biometrics with browser APIs, and I'm also curious about how you can setup things like paying with Apple Pay or other touchless payments, by way of with a website. I still have to look into that one next as well.

It looks like there are a few different methods to setup payments on the web, does Apple Pay JS use the Payment Request API under the hood?
